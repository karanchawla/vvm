# VVM Example 01: Hello World
# The simplest possible VVM program

# Define an agent with a model and system prompt
agent writer(model="haiku", prompt="You write concise, witty commit messages.")

# Call the agent with a task - result is bound to `message`
# The `(())` passes an empty input since we don't need one here
message = @writer `Write a commit message for fixing a typo in the README.`(())

# Export makes this value available as program output
export message
