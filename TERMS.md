Last updated: January 2024

## License

VVM is distributed under the MIT License. See `LICENSE` for the full text.

## Disclaimer of Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

## Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

## User Responsibility

### Agent Execution

VVM programs spawn AI agents that can:
- Make API calls
- Execute code
- Read and write files
- Access network resources

**You are responsible for:**
- The actions of agents spawned by your VVM programs
- Ensuring agents have appropriate permissions
- Reviewing agent outputs before using them
- Complying with the terms of service of underlying AI providers

### Content

VVM is a tool for orchestrating AI agents. The content generated by those agents is not created by VVM.

**You are responsible for:**
- The prompts you provide to agents
- Reviewing and validating agent outputs
- Ensuring generated content complies with applicable laws
- Respecting intellectual property rights

### Security

VVM provides a `permissions` system for sandboxing agents, but it relies on the underlying AI tool to enforce those permissions.

**You should:**
- Use the principle of least privilege
- Review agent permissions before execution
- Test programs in safe environments first
- Never grant unnecessary permissions

## Acceptable Use

You agree not to use VVM to:
- Create malware or malicious software
- Generate illegal content
- Circumvent AI provider safety measures
- Violate the terms of service of underlying AI providers
- Harm individuals or organizations

## Third-Party Services

VVM programs may interact with third-party AI services (e.g., Claude, GPT). Your use of those services is governed by their respective terms of service.

VVM is not affiliated with or endorsed by any AI provider.

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date at the top of this document.
